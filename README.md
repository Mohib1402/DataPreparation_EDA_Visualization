# Time Series and Machine Learning Analysis

This repository contains comprehensive analyses and machine learning projects centered around two datasets:

1. **Titanic Dataset** - A classic dataset used for binary classification tasks, where the goal is to predict survival based on various passenger attributes.
2. **Apple Stocks Dataset** - Historical stock prices of Apple Inc., used for time series analysis, feature engineering, clustering, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling.
